> âŒš slotpicker, a nice and simple time slot picker, its actually a React component, i hope you find it useful

**please note that this package is using [dayjs](https://github.com/iamkun/dayjs), its more lightweight then moment and have the same exact syntax that momentjs is using**

_Available in three langs: **ar, en and fr**, if you know any other, you can edit the lang.js file_

[See Demo](https://rc-slotpicker.netlify.app)

<br />

### Install

```bash
npm install slotpicker
```

<hr />

### Usage

```javascript
import SlotPicker from 'slotpicker';

<SlotPicker
  // Required, interval between two slots in minutes, 30 = 30 min
  interval={30}
  // Required, when user selects a time slot, you will get the "from" selected value in secs
  onSelectTime={selectedSlot => alert(selectedSlot)}
  // Optional, array of unavailable time slots
  unAvailableSlots={[12 * 60, 15 * 60]}
  // Optional, if you have a calendar with the time picker, put it here
  selectedDate={new Date()}
  // Optional, 8 = 08:00 AM, the start of the slots
  from={8 * 60}
  // Optional,  20 = 08:00 PM, the end of the time
  to={20 * 60}
  // Optional, selected slot color
  selectedSlotColor="#F09999"
  // Optional, language of the displayed text, default is english (en)
  lang={'ar'}
  // Optional, 13 = 01:00 PM, will be selected by default
  defaultSelectedTime={13 * 60}
/>;
```

> the **selectedSlot** you will get in the **onSelectTime** prop, is the "from" slot, if you want to display like the "from" and "to" selected slots its simple, the **_from = selectedSlot and to = selectedSlot + interval_**, use dayjs or momentjs to convert the secs to a readable format

**hint**: If you are storing the slots in some db, store them as seconds like that, then get them and convert them as i said using dayjs or momentjs

### Props

```ts
interface SlotPickerProps {
   interval: number
   onSelectTime: (from: number) => any
   unAvailableSlots?: Array<number>
   selectedDate?: Date
   from?: number
   to?: number
   selectedSlotColor?: string
   lang?: 'ar' | 'en' | 'fr'
   defaultSelectedTime?: number
}
```

### TODO

- ~~[x] Rewrite the lib to TypeScript~~
